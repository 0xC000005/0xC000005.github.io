直述句
======

直述句是重复或引用他人说过的每个字。当我们在写作中使用直述句时，会在引用的字句前后标上双引号，并完整引用他人说过的话。我们会转述某人在「此刻」讲的话（例如在讲电话时），或在稍后把先前的对话转告他人。
======================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   She says, "What time will you be home?"

-   She said, "What time will you be home?" and I said, "I don't know! "

-   "There's a fly in my soup!" screamed Simone.

-   John said, "There's an elephant outside the window."

转述句
======

>   **转述句通常用来谈过去的事，因此我们通常会改变句子的时态。**我们会用
>   say丶tell丶ask 等转述词，并用 that 来引导要转述的话，不加引号。

>   She said, "I saw him." (直述句) = She said **that she had seen him**.
>   (转述句)

>   「that」可以省略：

>   She told him that she was happy. = She told him she was happy.

「SAY」和「TELL」
-----------------

>   当句中没有受词时，用「say」：

>   He said that he was tired.

>   当谈到谁跟谁讲了话，一律用「tell」（即间接受词）：

>   He told me that he was tired.

「TALK」和「SPEAK」
-------------------

>   用这些动词来描述交谈的动作：

>   He talked to us.

>   She was speaking on the telephone.

>   在这些动词后面加「about」来指谈论的事：

>   He talked (to us) about his parents.

>    

主将从现
========

>   在直述句改为转述句时，一般要将直述句的时态往前推

>   *She said, "I am tired." = She said that she was tired.*

| **直述句的说法**                         | **对应的转述句**                               |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **一般现在时**                           | **一般过去时**                                 |
| "I always **drink** coffee", she said    | She said that she always **drank** coffee.     |
| **现在进行时**                           | **过去进行时**                                 |
| "I **am reading** a book", he explained. | He explained that he **was reading** a book    |
| **一般过去时**                           | **过去完成时**                                 |
| "Bill **arrived** on Saturday", he said. | He said that Bill **had arrived** on Saturday. |

>    

>   如果转述动词是现在时，或原陈述句的内容对现在来说依然是如此（或者是已经完成了的），就不必改变时态。例如：

-   He says **he has missed** the train but **he'll catch** the next one.

-   We explained that **it is** very difficult to find our house.

>    

>   这些情态助词在转述句并不会改变：*might, could, would, should, ought to*

-   We explained, "It **could** be difficult to find our house." = We explained
    that it **could** be difficult to find our house.

-   She said, "I **might** bring a friend to the party." = She said that
    she **might** bring a friend to the party.

>   **I/me/my/mine, you/your/yours = him/his/her/hers**

>   **we/us/our/ours, you/your/yours = they/their/theirs**

>   *He said: "I like your new car." = He told her that he liked her new car.*

转述问题
========

>   **转述问题不能带问号！**

>    

字词顺序
--------

>   一般转述疑问句的字词顺序是将主词调到动词前，而且不必再使用 do 或 did：

>   举例

| **直述句**               | **转述句**                       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|

| "Where are you going?"   | She asked where I was going.     |
| "Why is she crying?"     | He asked why she was crying.     |

YES/NO 问句
-----------

>   这类问句会用 **ask + if / whether + 子句**来转述：

>   whether——时候，两个中一个

>   举例

| **直述句**                         | **转述句**                                     |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

| "Have you been to Bristol before?" | She asked if I had been to Bristol before.     |

疑问词
------

>   这类问句会用 **ask（或其他类似 ask 的动词）+ 疑问词 +
>   子句**来转述。子句含问句的内容，动词要移到最后面，并在必要时改变动词的时态。

>   举例

| **直述句**                                         | **转述句**                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| "What is your name?" he asked me.                  | He asked me what my name was.               |
