被动语态的作用
==============

被动语态是用来表示对「承受」某动作的人或物的关注，而不是关注「执行」某动作的人或物。换句话说，最重要的人或物变成句中的主词。

举例

-   The passive voice **is used** frequently. (=
    我们关注的是被动语态，而不是关注使用被动语态的人)

-   The house **was built** in 1654. (=
    我们关注的是房屋，而不是关注建造房屋的人)

-   The road** is being repaired**. (= 我们关注的是道路，而不是关注修理道路的人)

有时候我们之所以会被动语态，是因为我们不知道丶不想表达执行动作的人或物。

举例

-   I noticed that a window **had been left** open.

-   Every year thousands of people **are killed** on our roads.

-   All the cookies **have been eaten**.

-   My car **has been stolen**!

被动语态常用在正式书写上，改用主动语态会让您的语句较清楚且容易理解。

| **被动**                                                            | **主动**                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| A great deal of meaning** is conveyed **by a few well-chosen words. | A few well-chosen words **convey** a great deal of meaning.    |
| Our planet **is wrapped** in a mass of gases.                       | A mass of gases **wrap** around our planet.                    |
| Waste materials **are disposed** of in a variety of ways.           | The city **disposes** of waste materials in a variety of ways. |

如果在用被动语态时仍想表明执行动作的人或物，这时候就要用介词
by。当我们知道做动作的人是谁，也想强调这个人或事物，改用主动语态总是会比较好。

| **被动**                                             | **主动**                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| "A Hard Day's Night" **was written by** the Beatles. | The Beatles **wrote** "A Hard Day's Night". |
| The movie ET **was directed by** Spielberg.          | Spielberg **directed** the movie ET.        |
| This house** was built by** my father.               | My father** built** this house.             |

被动语态的构成

英语的被动语态是以两个要素组成：

**适当的 Be 动词型态 + 过去分词**

| **肯定句**                       | **否定句**                          | **疑问句**                       | **否定疑问句**                      |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| The house was built in 1899.     | The house wasn't built in 1899.     | Was the house built in 1899?     | Wasn't the house built in 1899?     |
| These houses were built in 1899. | These houses weren't built in 1899. | Were these houses built in 1899? | Weren't these houses built in 1899? |

被动语态，以 TO CLEAN 为例

| **主词**         | **+ Be 动词（经过词形变化）** | **+ 过去分词** | **+ 句子的其余字词**  |
|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| **一般现在时**   |                               |                |                       |
| The house        | is                            | cleaned        | every day.            |
| **现在进行时**   |                               |                |                       |
| The house        | is being                      | cleaned        | at the moment.        |
| **一般过去时**   |                               |                |                       |
| The house        | was                           | cleaned        | yesterday.            |
| **过去进行时**   |                               |                |                       |
| The house        | was being                     | cleaned        | last week.            |
| **现在完成时**   |                               |                |                       |
| The house        | has been                      | cleaned        | since you left.       |
| **过去完成时**   |                               |                |                       |
| The house        | had been                      | cleaned        | before they arrived.  |
| **一般将来时**   |                               |                |                       |
| The house        | will be                       | cleaned        | next week.            |
| **将来进行时**   |                               |                |                       |
| The house        | will be being                 | cleaned        | tomorrow.             |
| **条件式现在时** |                               |                |                       |
| The house        | would be                      | cleaned        | if they had visitors. |
| **条件式过去时** |                               |                |                       |
| The house        | would have been               | cleaned        | if it had been dirty. |
| **不定式**       |                               |                |                       |
| The house        | must be                       | cleaned        | before we arrive.     |

带有不定词的被动语态

不定被动语态用于情态助词后，还有其他多数接不定词的动词后。

举例

-   You **have to be tested** on your English grammar.

-   John **might be promoted** next year.

-   She **wants to be invited** to the party.

-   I **expect to be surprised** on my birthday.

-   You **may be disappointed**.

带有动名词的被动语态

动名词用在介词后，以及一般会接动名词的动词后。

举例

-   I **remember being taught** to drive.

-   The children are excited **about being taken** to the zoo.

-   The children are excited **to be taken** to the zoo.

-   Most film stars **hate being interviewed**.

-   Most film stars **hate to be interviewed**.

-   Poodles **like to be pampered**.

-   Poodles **like being pampered**.

TO BE BORN 的用法

「to be
born」是一种被动型态，而且多数主要用于过去时。然而在某些情况下，使用现在时或将来时也很妥当。

举例

-   I** was born** in 1976.

-   Where **were you born**?

-   Around 100 babies **are born** in this hospital every week.

-   We don't know on exactly which day the baby **will be born**.

有时被动语态的构成会用动词 to get 或 to have 来取代 Be 动词。

被动语态与主动语态的转换
========================

用主动语态写的句子会比被动语态的句子还要容易理解。将被动语态转为主动语态很简单，但需要练习才能彻底掌握。在以下的对应表中，请注意被动句的
Be
动词时态一律和主动句的主要动词时态相同。为了要用主动语态，您必须明确表示做动作的主词为何。
